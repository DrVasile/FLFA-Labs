## Overview
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; 


## Objectives:
1. Learn about Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) [1].
2. Get familiar with the approaches of normalizing a grammar.
3. Implement a method for normalizing an input grammar by the rules of CNF.
    1. The implementation needs to be encapsulated in a method with an appropriate signature (also ideally in an appropriate class/type).
    2. The implemented functionality needs executed and tested.
    3. A BONUS point will be given for the student who will have unit tests that validate the functionality of the project.
    4. Also, another BONUS point would be given if the student will make the aforementioned function to accept any grammar, not only the one from the student's variant.


## Evaluation:
1. The project should be located in a __*public*__ repository on a git hosting service (preferably Github).

  * You only need to have one repository.
  * Please don't name your folders based on the lab work (e.g. Lab1, Lab2 etc.). You'll be penalized for this.
  * Please organize your files in a logical way for easier access.

2. It should contain an explanation in the form of a Markdown with the standard structure from the ../REPORT_TEMPLATE.md file. The report needs to be put with the other reports in the corresponding folder.

3. In order to make the evaluation as optimal as possible you should obey the indications and document the project accordingly so that I could evaluate them by myself. The works can be presented by you as well if you want either at the lectures or online.

4. You need to submit on ELSE the URL to the repository. Not a huge letter/message to me telling what you did, or some .zip file or other meaningless stuff. Just the URL. And preferably a valid URL so that I won't waste time trying to find your repo on Github.

5. If the work doesn't correspond to the requirements I'll revert the submission and leave some comments. If needed you can reach out and ask questions. 

7. The deadline for this assignment is __18/03/2022::23:59:59:99__.

8. After the deadline, the students will have to present the laboratory works, and for each week, the max grade would be decreased by 1.
